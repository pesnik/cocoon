# Cocoon

### *Your Passwords, Safely Enfolded.*

-----

Cocoon is a secure, Rust-powered password manager designed for speed and convenience on your Windows machine. Inspired by the natural world's most protective enclosures, Cocoon keeps your digital credentials safely enfolded, accessible with just a quick keystroke whenever you need them.

## Why Cocoon?

In today's digital landscape, strong, unique passwords are your first line of defense. But remembering them all is impossible, and typing them out is tedious. Cocoon offers a solution that balances ironclad security with unparalleled ease of use, all built with the performance and safety guarantees of **Rust**.

## Key Features (Planned & In Progress)

  * **Quick Access Hotkey:** Just like `Win + V` for your clipboard history, a customizable global hotkey brings up Cocoon's intuitive search interface instantly. Find and copy your credentials in seconds.
  * **Robust Encryption:** Your passwords are encrypted using industry-standard, battle-tested algorithms (e.g., AES-256 GCM) and strong Key Derivation Functions (e.g., Argon2), ensuring your data remains private and secure.
  * **Intuitive Search:** Start typing, and Cocoon will quickly filter your entries, making it effortless to find what you're looking for.
  * **Secure Clipboard Management:** Passwords copied to your clipboard are automatically cleared after a short, configurable delay, preventing sensitive data from lingering.
  * **Cross-Platform (Future Goal):** While initially focused on Windows, Cocoon is being built with future expansion to other operating systems in mind.
  * **Open Source:** Transparency is key to security. Cocoon's source code will be openly available for review, audit, and community contributions.
