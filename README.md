# Cocoon

### *Your Passwords, Safely Enfolded.*

-----

Cocoon is a secure, cross-platform password manager built with Rust, designed for speed and convenience. Inspired by the natural world's most protective enclosures, Cocoon keeps your digital credentials safely enfolded, accessible whenever you need them.

## Why Cocoon?

In today's digital landscape, strong, unique passwords are your first line of defense. But remembering them all is impossible, and typing them out is tedious. Cocoon offers a solution that balances ironclad security with ease of use, all built with the performance and safety guarantees of **Rust**.

## Development

### Building from Source

Ensure you have Rust installed (visit [rustup.rs](https://rustup.rs/) for installation instructions).

```bash
# Clone and build
git clone https://github.com/pesnik/cocoon.git
cd cocoon
cargo build --release

# Run tests
cargo test

# Run in development mode
cargo run
```

### Platform-Specific Notes

## Security

**Current Security Features:**
- **Local-Only Storage**: Your passwords never leave your device
- **Memory-Safe Implementation**: Built with Rust to prevent common security vulnerabilities
- **Auto-Hide Protection**: Window automatically hides when focus is lost
- **No Network Access**: Cocoon operates entirely offline

**Important Security Note:** 
The current MVP stores passwords in a local JSON file for rapid development and testing. **This is not suitable for production use with sensitive data.** The next major update will implement strong encryption with a master password.

**Planned Security Enhancements:**
- **AES-256 GCM encryption** for data at rest
- **Argon2** key derivation function for master password
- **Zero-knowledge architecture** - only you can decrypt your data
- **Secure memory handling** for sensitive operations
- **Optional two-factor authentication**
